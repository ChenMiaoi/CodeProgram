As a magician , I try to create images that make people stop and think

I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible

As a magician ,I try to show things to people that seem impossible

And I think magic ,whether I am holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards, is pretty simple

It's practice, it's training.

And it' s practice, it' s training and experimenting ,while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be

And that's what magic is to me, so ,thank you. (Applause)

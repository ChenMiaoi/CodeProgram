Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world and you did

But somewhere along the line you changed

You stopped being you ,

You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you are no good

And when things got hard ,you started looking for something to blame like a big shadow.

Let me tell you something you already know

The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows

It' s a very mean and nasty place ,and I don' t care how tough you are

It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it
